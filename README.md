Minimal web to lead example for the close.io API.

Requires HTTParty to connect with close.io, Sinatra to serve the form, and Slim, because it's a phat templating language.  The "lead" hash is converted to JSON, from Sinatra form parameters.

TODO:
Add tests.  Yes, I should have started with the tests first.
